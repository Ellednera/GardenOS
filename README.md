# GardenOS (currently for Windows only)
## The executable file is not available at the moment
A simple and useful command line tool with a garden theme. This project(for fun) is still in developement.

There are 2 important programs here--gardenOS.pl(actual) and valcom.pl(for testing codes and ideas)

The structure and the commands supported can be found in:

  -build_log.txt
  -program_notes.txt
  -everything in the "details" sub-folder

There isn't any official documentation of the commands yet, sorry about that
