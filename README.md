# GardenOS
### (currently for Windows only)
### The executable file is not available at the moment
A simple and useful command line program with a garden theme. This project (for fun) is still in developement. This is a beginner's project :)

There are 2 important programs--gardenOS.pl (the actual program) and valcom.pl (for testing codes and ideas)

The explanations of the program structure and the commands available can be found in:

  -build_log.txt
  
  -program_notes.txt
  
  -everything in the "details" sub-folder
  

There isn't any official documentation of the commands yet, sorry about that

### Notes
1. A lot of the codes need refactoring
2. The direct subroutine calling may be changed (most subroutines will be stored in a hash as subroutine reference). Hence, the command validation (part 2-1 in gardenOS.pl) might be replaced with something more efficient
4. This project will only be considered as completed when the garden (maybe an oyster bed too) is successfully implemented. This will make the program both a tool and a game
5. The name of this program might change too in the future
