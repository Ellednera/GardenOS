Perl-for fun
Idea: a command line as os
Includes: flower and plants terminology as commands
Main: controls directories and files
Name: Garden-OS

All command will be execute through existing cmd commands if needed, ie windows only :)
If not, then we'll leave it to Perl
Able to execute very os-specific files with surprises
maybe make some predefined programs, like the ones in Unix, Linux etc, cat, tac, ls, rm, mv etc
Graphics: implement in the future
Most commands will have responses

First stage: make sure to create it's own dir. for all its files etc, several files shuold not be editable
2nd: make sure it has several commands to do certain things, could be anything

Terminology (redefined): 
Original		Redefined(can be in plural form)	examples					notes
help			Hashem								Hashem -help			case sensitive, very, a global command
help(hints)		prayfor								prayfor hints			hints about the game, random
help(hints)		prayfor								prayfor parnasah		affects the garden and the scoring system and the pearl too
-				offer								offer Hashem pearl 		unlock all locked/not-ye obtained features, the pearl is everyting
-				offer								offer Hashem [flower_name] flower_name is the bloom, bloom with specific extension is special
make the pearl hard to obtain

executables		[flower name(s)]
file			leaf
directory		branch
home			trunk
root			root
desktop(cd)		treehouse
create			plant								plant seed(s) arg(s)  
create			grow								grow branch | leaf
create			bloom								bloom [flower name(s)]		surprises on the screen after opening it, can be given to Hashem to gain new blooms, or just buy from the store :)
dir				explore
dir				explore branch													show only the directories
dir				explore leaf													show only files in the current working directory
"super" dir		explode															shows all the dir & files starting from the cwd
change dir		visit/move						
delete			break|strip/nip						break [leaf [leaf_name]...] this type can reduce programming work, I'm not sure about that....
path/%cd%		address
cd				visit/move
cd..			leave

The garden
-				name								name garden [new_garden_name] needs to be modified in the future
-				visit								visit garden				garden is a built-in game
-				find								find garden
-				destroy								destroy garden				restart the game
-				inspect								inspect garden				must be inside the garden to inspect
-				water								water garden				water everything in one go
-				plant								plant flower|tree|vege
..				leave								leave garden				this should be a global command, with any arg, go back once
"dir"			search								search [pearl|flower|tree|vege]	the pearl will unlock all the locked/not-yet obtained features of the os
Maybe this garden stuff shuold have a scoring system that will affect the other commands
The flowers in the garden should affect the "bloom flower" command
The pearl, hmm... maybe we need to add oysters :)

(these features only affect the program itself, not the computer)
start			morning
hibernate		freeze
shutdown		night
reformat(I)		wither								wither [os_name]		reformat step by step
reformat(II)	replant								replant [os_name]		let program do it's work
reformat		withdraw							neshama [os_name]_widthdraw		revert to the very core of the program, the skeleton, empty os
