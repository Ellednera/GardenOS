	Any commands that cause something new to appear on your system are listed here	
2. DESTRUCTIVE
	Any commands that deletes stuff from your system can be found here. 
	!! Take note that commands listed here are SUPER DESTRUCTIVE and the end result is IRREVERSIBLE. Because of its super destructive nature,
