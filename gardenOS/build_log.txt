Garden OS Build Log

4 FEB 2021
	1. Created the "engine", the os is mamash running correctly, baruch Hashem!
	2. Implemented several simple commands
	
5 FEB 2021
	1. Added more commands (grow branch, break branch)
	2. Implemented the corresponding codes
	3. A command validator script was created for testing purposes.
		All the codes are written there first (resembling the actual script means better)
		This file was named valcom.pl [ maybe name it ValCom? :) ]
		Checking of logic is done in valcome then in the actual script
	4. Remembered that the File::Path module can be used to remove trees (use it!)
		add options/flags to "activate this one" so that we don't need to delete 
		too much codes :)

7 FEB 2021
	1. Implemented the flag command, "break branch -force", currently only allow standard
		commands
	2. Tried the File::Path module, successful, but there's some strange problems with its
		error reporting part, used $! instead when removing folder containing sub-directories.
	3. Changed the "home" command to "trunk", that's more like it :)
	4. Refactored the commands that need the eval block to function.
	
8 FEB 2021
	1. Implemented the command/syntax parser.
	2. Flagged commands and standard commands are in a separate part of the program
	3. The $do_sth variable will no longer be used, $flagged_command will be replaced instead.
		When it is 0, it means it's just a normal/standard command. If 1, then it is a flagged command
	4. The &flag_parser subroutine was initially put in the action part, which was wrong! 
		Moved it to the validation part (Part 1)
	5. The flagged command (break branch -force) was remove from the @commands array. It will rely on 
		the &flag_parser subroutine to determine its validity in Part 1
		
10 FEB 2021
	1. Implemented the grow_leaf subroutine. This is similar to creating a new file.
	2. "grow leaf" command registered and activated. Tested, passed.
		
11 FEB 2021
	1. Implemented the nip leaf command to delete single file. (See program notes for more details)
	2. "nip leaf" command registered and activated. Tested, passed.
	3. Extended the "main" loop so that pressing enter with no command at all will cause the program to 
		behave the same as actual DOS or linux terminal, which does nothing	and doesn't give out the 
		"Can't understand ''" message.
	4. Fixed the "explore leaf" bug. It will no longer show items based on extension because a folder can have
		a dot too. The file testing operator -f will be used instead.

13 FEB 2021
	1. Implemented the "visit" command to change directory. 
		Command registered and activated. Tested, passed
	2. Implemented the "leave" command to step-back 1 directory.
		Command registered and activated. Tested, passed.
	3. Implemented the "grow leaves" command to create multiple files in one go. It is optimized.
		Command registered and activated. Tested, passed.
	4. The "visit" command is not tested to change to another disk yet. It should work.
		
14 FEB 2021
	1. Experimental "nip leaf -all" success. (See valcom.pl)
		Command implemented, registers, activated and tested. Success.
		
15 FEB 2021
	1. Corrected some of the output text.
	2. Added a branch label for the "explore" command to differentiate between folders and files easily.
		
25 FEB 2021
	1. Started the "nip leaf -some" and "nip leaf -most" features in valcom.
	2. "nip leaf -some" feature is complete in valcom. Needs testing in actual program.
		Testing passed. Implemented in the actual program.
	3. "nip leaf -most" was implemented and tested directly in actual program. Success.
	4. Factored the unlink file part into a function that unlinks a single file. This is used with the for loop
		and it uses $_ variable from the for loop.
		*Name of subroutine: &_nip_a_leaf_with_warnings($leafname);
		*Notes: Since this is usually used in a for loop with the default control variable $_, most of the places 
				calling this subroutine is called as &_nip_a_leaf_with_warnings($_)
	5. Added a banner. Nice~
	6. Corrected some of the output text.

26 FEB 2021
	1. Corrected the multiple filenames input regex spliting problem. \s? changed to \s+
	2. Added a new command (treehouse) to return to the desktop. The "trunk" command might not be useful after 
		implementing this command.
	3. Edited the program_notes.txt
